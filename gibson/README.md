# Gibson Reading Group

[James Gibson’s *The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception*](https://archive.org/details/pdfy-u5hmFOvOM2Civ4Gz/mode/2up) is a classic, idiosyncratic book about how we see the world around us.
Every week or so, we’ll read a section of the book and have a Zoom meeting to discuss the chapter, mull over related ideas, and chat about how it might relate to our own current (or future!) work.

Why read an odd philosophical book from the late 1970s?
Our field has been salivating over links between representations in brain areas and “performance-optimized models”
(i.e., deep neural networks) that are performing similar tasks
But are the tasks really similar?
ImageNet tries to put accurate, highly specific labels on everything.
We mostly don’t.

[Weekly notes are here](notes.md).

When I walk down the street (remember that?),
I don’t classify every single thing I see so that some inner homunculus knows the location of `English Spaniel (Beineim)’
or `Self-propelled Motorized Vehicle (used)’.
Instead, I extract a few pieces of specific, actionable information from the scene: do I know that person?
Does their dog seem friendly or vicious?
Will their actions bring the dog’s owner within 2m of me—and if so, where can I flee?
In this book, Gibson develops a theory of ‘affordances’ that let us perceive and act on the environment.
I’m hoping that this will prod us to think more about behaviors and the representations needed to support them.
